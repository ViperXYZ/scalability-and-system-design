# Scalability and System Design

The goal of this repo is to provide a better understanding of system design, the tools associated with it, and how to build a scalable system.  

1. [General knowledge](./01_general_knowledge/README.md): covers all the concepts associated with making a scalable system
2. [Architecture](./02_architecture/README.md): goes over architectures of different companies and how to design a system based on certain constraints
3. [Tools](./03_tools/README.md): introduces the different tools that can be used to make a robust, scalable system
